# CryptoCurrency

As people are getting increasingly interested in cryptocurrencies, it would be convenient to have a web app that shows different cryptocurrencies and the market info. User can browse, compare market price, and read crypto news in one web app.
This project is inspired by Cryptoverse project from [JavaScript Mastery YouTube video channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DDX3US3kss&t=268s).
